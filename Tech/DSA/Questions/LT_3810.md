## 📝 Problem Description
> [!info] Description
> You are given two integer arrays nums and target, each of length n, where nums[i] is the current value at index i and target[i] is the desired value at index i.
You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):
Choose an integer value x
Find all maximal contiguous segments where nums[i] == x (a segment is maximal if it cannot be extended to the left or right while keeping all values equal to x)
For each such segment [l, r], update simultaneously:
nums[l] = target[l], nums[l + 1] = target[l + 1], ..., nums[r] = target[r]
Return the minimum number of operations required to make nums equal to target.
